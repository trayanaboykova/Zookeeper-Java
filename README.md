# 🦁 Zookeeper Program with Java  

I built this project as part of my journey to mastering Java fundamentals through practical and engaging programs. The **Zookeeper** project is a console-based application that helps zookeepers monitor animals in different habitats. It allowed me to apply core programming concepts while developing an interactive tool for managing zoo animals.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project was part of **JetBrains Academy's** training projects and helped me strengthen my understanding of Java syntax, loops, user input handling, and data structures. The program enables users to view different animals by entering a habitat number, displaying relevant ASCII art and descriptions.  

## 🎯 What I Learned  
- 🏗️ Introduction to Java  
- 🔢 Working with variables and data types  
- 🎤 Handling user input and console output  
- 🔄 Using loops (`while`) for continuous interaction  
- 📦 Implementing arrays to store data  
- 📝 Structuring and organizing code effectively  

## 🔧 Features  
✅ Allows users to enter a habitat number and view corresponding animals  
✅ Displays ASCII art and a description of each animal  
✅ Supports multiple habitats, including lions, rabbits, camels, and bats  
✅ Implements a continuous loop for multiple queries  
✅ Provides an exit option for user convenience  

## 📂 Project Structure  
The project was implemented in stages, progressively enhancing functionality:  

1. **Basic Output**:  
   - Displayed introductory text and simple output.  

2. **Animal Display**:  
   - Printed ASCII art for a specific animal.  

3. **Habitat Selection**:  
   - Allowed users to enter a number to view animals in different habitats.  

4. **Looping Mechanism**:  
   - Enabled continuous user interaction without restarting the program.  

5. **Exit Functionality**:  
   - Implemented an exit command for seamless user experience.

## 🤔 How to Run  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Zookeeper-Java.git
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. Enter a habitat number to view the corresponding animal!

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I:

- Strengthened my understanding of Java basics.
- Gained experience handling user input and managing loops.
- Learned to use arrays for storing and retrieving structured data.
- Developed an interactive console application with real-world use cases.
- Improved my ability to structure Java programs efficiently.
